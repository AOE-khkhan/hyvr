<h1>HYVR Computational methods<a class="headerlink" href="#hyvr-computational-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The first step in the HyVR algorithm is to load the model parameters, as defined in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.ini</span></code> initialisation file. Sequence contact surfaces are generated first. Architectural element assemblage contact surfaces are then simulated within each sequence, either based on input parameters or loaded from a user-defined lookup table of mean contact surface depths. The external and internal geometries of architectural elements and associated hydrofacies are then simulated within each architectural element assemblage. Finally, internal heterogeneity of the features is simulated.</p>
<p><em>Note that in this section model input parameters are denoted in the following manner:</em> <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parameter-section.parameter</span></code>.</p>
<div class="section" id="simulation-of-sequence-and-architectural-element-unit-contact-surfaces">
<h2>Simulation of sequence and architectural element unit contact surfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#simulation-of-sequence-and-architectural-element-unit-contact-surfaces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sequences are defined in the input parameter file by their upper mean elevations and the architectural elements that are to be included within them. The upper contact surface is then generated and all model cells between the lower and upper contact surface are assigned to the sequence.</p>
<p>Contact surfaces can either be flat or random. Multi-Gaussian random contact surfaces are generated using the spectral methods outlined by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dietrich1993" id="id1">[DN93]</a>.  These methods require structural statistical parameters (i.e. mean and variance) for the quantity of interest, and a geostatistical covariance model. We used a Gaussian covariance model in the present study:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(R_{ss}(h)=\sigma^2_s \exp\left[ - \left[ \frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\right]^2 \right]\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is the random quantity of interest, <span class="math">\(\sigma^2_s\)</span> is the variance of <span class="math">\(s\)</span> (here elevation), <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> is the distance between the two points, and <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is the correlation length.</p>
<p>Simulation at the architectural element hierarchical level begins once all sequence units have been assigned. Units in which AEs will be simulated are defined using an architectural element lookup table with the following information:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="28%" />
<col width="18%" />
<col width="16%" />
<col width="22%" />
<col width="16%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Architectural element identifier</td>
<td>Mean bottom elevation</td>
<td>Mean top elevation</td>
<td>Architectural element type</td>
<td>Sequence identifier</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the architectural element lookup table is not defined before initialising the simulation, then the architectural element units will be simulated based on input parameters defined for each sequence. This starts with the random choice of an architectural element from those defined; the probability of each architectural element being chosen is also defined in the input parameter file. The thickness of the architectural element unit is then drawn from a random normal distribution that is defined for each sequence in the input parameter file. To account for the erosive nature of many sedimentary environments the algorithm may erode the underlying units: here the &#8216;avulsion&#8217; thickness <span class="math">\(th_{avulsion}\)</span> is subtracted from the bottom and top of the architectural element unit <span class="math">\(z^{bot}_{AE}, z^{top}_{AE}\)</span>. Once the architectural element lookup table has been defined, unit contact surfaces are generated using the same procedure as used for sequence contact surfaces. When the architectural element units have been generated, the algorithm begins to simulate external architectural element geometries and hydrofacies.</p>

<h2>Simulation of architectural elements and hydrofacies geometries<a class="headerlink" href="#simulation-of-architectural-elements-and-hydrofacies-geometries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The generation of architectural elements and internal hydrofacies occurs sequence- and architectural-elementwise, beginning with the lowest architectural element unit in the lowest sequence. The simulation of individual architectural elements is object-based, with random placement of features within the architectural element units. Object-based methods have been implemented widely in subsurface simulation <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#jussel1994" id="id2">[JSD94]</a><a class="reference internal" href="references.html#bennett2017" id="id3">[BHC17]</a> as they are generally computationally efficient and relatively easy to parameterize. The HyVR program approximates architectural elements with simple geometric shapes. Currently, three <a class="reference internal" href="#shapes">shapes</a> are supported: truncated ellipsoids, channels, and sheets. Truncated ellipsoids and channels are &#8216;erosive&#8217; architectural elements: this means that within the HyVR algorithm they are able to erode underlying units, and therefore the architectural element (and sequence) boundaries may be altered during the course of the simulation.</p>

<p>Four properties are assigned to each model grid cell during this simulation step: material, facies, azimuth, and dip. The material property is a unique identifier for each individual architectural element generated. The facies property denotes which hydrofacies has been assigned to a model grid cell. The azimuth <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span> and dip <span class="math">\(\psi\)</span> properties are associated with the bedding structure at each model grid cell and denote the angle of the bedding plane from the mean direction of flow and horizontal, respectively.</p>

<span id="temethod"></span><h3>Truncated ellipsoids<a class="headerlink" href="#truncated-ellipsoids" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Truncated ellipsoids are generated as a proxy for trough-like features. The method for generating the boundaries of these features has been described previously in <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#bennett2017" id="id4">[BHC17]</a>. Generation starts at <span class="math">\(z^{bot}_{AE unit} +AE_{depth}\cdot\beta\)</span> where <span class="math">\(AE_{depth}\)</span> is the depth of the truncated ellipsoid geometry, and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is a buffer term that allows the user to control how much of the underlying unit is eroded. The centre of the truncated ellipsoid (<span class="math">\(x,y\)</span> coordinates) and the paleoflow angle <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> (i.e. major ellipsoid axis orientation) are drawn from a random uniform distribution and the boundary of the truncated ellipsoid is simulated.

<div class="section" id="bulbs">
<h4>Bulbs<a class="headerlink" href="#bulbs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Bulb internal heterogeneity is simulated by calculating the three-dimensional gradient at the boundary of the truncated ellipsoid and then the angle between the gradient and a horizontal plane. This angle is then compared with a &#8216;maximum dip angle&#8217; (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r_dip</span></code>) and the smaller of these two values is assigned to all model grid cells within the architectural element with equivalent <span class="math">\(x,y\)</span>-coordinates (i.e. column-wise).</p>

<div class="section" id="nested-bulbs">
<h4>Nested bulbs<a class="headerlink" href="#nested-bulbs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Nested-bulb-like layers are simulated by subdividing the depth of the truncated ellipsoid into a series with a set thickness <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trunc_ellip.bulbset_d</span></code>. Truncated ellipsoids are simulated consecutively with the same center point and paleoflow <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> value, starting with the deepest element. With each simulation, a scaling factor is calculated by dividing the new depth with the total depth of the element. This scaling factor is applied to the length and width parameters of the truncated ellipsoid. Each newly generated ellipsoid subsumes the previous. Each nested element represents a constant hydrofacies, however the orientation of these hydrofacies may differ within the entire architectural element, to create bulb-like features that have been reported in the field. The dip of the nested ellipsoids defaults to that determined by the three-dimension gradient at the nested-ellipsoid boundary.</p>

<div class="section" id="channels">
<h3>Channels<a class="headerlink" href="#channels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Channels are sinusoidal features that are in-filled with sediment. Channel centrelines in HyVR are parameterized using the disturbed periodic model implemented by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#ferguson1976" id="id5">[Fer76]</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\theta + \frac{2h}{k} \frac{d\theta}{ds} + \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{d^2\theta}{ds^2}  = \epsilon(s)\)</span></p>
<p>with channel direction <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>, damping factor <span class="math">\(h \in [0,1]\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k = 2\pi/\lambda\)</span> is the wavenumber with <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> the frequency of the undamped sine wave, and <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is the distance along the channel. This model can be approximated using the following second-order autoregressive model described in Equation 15 of <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#ferguson1976" id="id6">[Fer76]</a> (this method was also used by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#pyrcz2009" id="id7">[PBD09]</a> for the simulation of alluvial depositional features). Model grid cells are assigned to the channel if the following conditions are met:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(D^2 \leqslant \frac{w^2_{ch}}{4} - \left[ \frac{(z_{ch} - z_{cell})\cdot\Delta z \cdot w_{ch}}{d_{ch}} \right] ^2 \; \wedge \; z_{cell} \leqslant z_{ch}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(D^2\)</span> is the two-dimensional (<span class="math">\(x,y\)</span>) distance from the cell to the channel centerline, <span class="math">\(w_{ch}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d_{ch}\)</span> are the channel width and depth respectively, <span class="math">\(z_{ch}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z_{cell}\)</span> are the elevations of the channel top and node respectively, and <span class="math">\(\Delta z\)</span> is the model grid cell <span class="math">\(z\)</span> dimension. Two-dimensional channel velocities <span class="math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> are evaluated at the centerline and then interpolated to grid cells using an inverse-distance-weighted interpolation. Azimuth values are calculated by taking the arctangent of the two-dimensional channel velocity at a given point. Dip values of grid cells within the channel are assigned based on input parameters. If alternating hydrofacies are to be simulated they are constructed by creating planes that are evenly spaced along the channel centerline.</p>
<p>The HyVR algorithm generates channels starting from <span class="math">\(z^{bot}_{AE unit} +AE_{depth}\cdot\beta\)</span>, as for truncated ellipsoids. However, to account for the multiple channels that are often concurrently present in many river systems, multiple channels can be generated at each simulation depth (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">channel.channel_no</span></code>). The starting <span class="math">\(x,y\)</span> coordinates for the centerlines are drawn from a random uniform distribution such that <span class="math">\(x\in[-50,0]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\in[0,Y]\)</span>. Channel geometries are then assigned sequentially to the model grid cells; note that in HyVR there is no interaction of channels, and subsequent channels will supersede (or &#8216;erode&#8217;) those previously generated.  Once the predefined number of channels stipulated by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">channel.channel_no</span></code> has been simulated a three-dimensional migration vector <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">channel.r_mig</span></code> is added to the channel centerlines and the channel assignment to model grid cells begins again. The reuse of the channel centerline trajectories is more efficient than re-simulating these values at each <span class="math">\(z_{sim}\)</span>. This continues until  <span class="math">\(z_{sim} = z^{top}_{seq}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sheets">
<h3>Sheets<a class="headerlink" href="#sheets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sheets are comparatively simple to generate as they are laterally continuous across the entire model domain (depending on sequence boundaries). The internal structure of sheet features may be massive (i.e. without internal structure), or laminations can be generated.  In the HyVR algorithm laminations are simulated sequentially by assigning all model grid cells between a specific elevation interval the appropriate hydrofacies codes. Dipping set structures can also be incorporated into these features. Sheets may differ in internal orientation, as specified in the input parameters.</p>

<h3>Internal structure<a class="headerlink" href="#internal-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

In truncated ellipsoids the planes are constructed along the centerline of the element, perpendicular to the paleoflow angle <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. In channel elements, the planes are constructed along the centerline and are perpendicular to <span class="math">\(\vec{v}(x)\)</span>.

<h4>Alternating hydrofacies<a class="headerlink" href="#alternating-hydrofacies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sedimentary deposits can often exhibit cyclicity in their features; therefore, HyVR allows alternating hydrofacies to be simulated. This is controlled by sequentially assigning hydrofacies within each architectural element, starting with a hydrofacies randomly selected from those to be simulated in the architectural element (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">element.l_facies</span></code>). The hydrofacies which is assigned next is drawn from a subset of hydrofacies specified in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">element.ll_altfacies</span></code> input parameter. For each hydrofacies in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">element.l_facies</span></code>, a list of alternating hydrofacies (i.e. which hydrofacies can follow the present one) is stipulated. By only specifying one hydrofacies ID in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">element.ll_altfacies</span></code>, it guarantees that that ID will be selected. The figure below gives three examples of different input parameters.</p>

Simulation methods are the same as for within-element heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Spatial trends may also be applied once isotropic hydraulic-conductivity values have been assigned to all model grid cells. As for trends in architectural element geometry, trends are assigned using a linearly-interpolated factor <span class="math">\(\xi_{start},\xi_{end}\)</span> in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>- and/or <span class="math">\(z\)</span>-directions. The value of each model grid cell is then multiplied by the trend factors.</p>

<span id="tensorgen"></span><h3>Hydraulic-conductivity tensors<a class="headerlink" href="#hydraulic-conductivity-tensors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Full hydraulic-conductivity tensors for each model grid cell are  calculated by multiplying the isotropic hydraulic conductivity <span class="math">\(K^{iso}\)</span>, with a rotated anisotropy matrix <span class="math">\(\textbf{M}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\textbf{K}_i =K^{iso}_i\textbf{R}_i\textbf{M}_i\textbf{R}_i^T\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(\textbf{R}_i = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\kappa_i)\cos(\psi_i) &amp; \sin(\kappa_i) &amp; \cos(\kappa_i)\sin(\psi_i)\\ -\sin(\kappa_i)\cos(\psi_i) &amp; \cos(\kappa_i) &amp; -\sin(\kappa_i)\sin(\psi_i)\\ -\sin(\psi_i) &amp; 0 &amp; \cos(\psi_i) \end{bmatrix}\)</span></p>
<p>Parameters <span class="math">\(\psi_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\kappa_i\)</span> are the simulated bedding structures (dip and azimuth, respectively). The anisotropy matrix <span class="math">\(\textbf{M}_i\)</span> is diagonal with lateral terms set as equivalent (i.e. <span class="math">\(K_{xx} = K_{yy}\)</span>). This approach is identical to that of <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#bennett2017" id="id10">[BHC17]</a>. Once this has been completed, the simulated parameter files are saved and can be used for groundwater flow and solute transport simulations.</p>
