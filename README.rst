The Hydrogeological Virtual Reality simulation package
========================================================

Welcome to HYVR. The simulation package is currently in development - come again soon.

Install
-------
The most current version of HYVR will be available on the github repository, but it is also available with pip.

To install HYVR we recommend first installing the `Anaconda distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ of Python 3 This distribution has the majority of dependencies that HYVR requires.

It is a good idea to install the HYVR package into a `virtual environment <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`>_. Do this by opening a command prompt window and typing the following:

::
	
	conda create --name hyvr_env
	
You need to then activate this environment:

::

	activate hyvr_env
	
Once this is completed you can install HYVR using pip:

::

	(hyvr_env) <working directory> pip install hyvr
